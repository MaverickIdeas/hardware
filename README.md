The WiFi-capable Particle Photon or better yet the cellular Particle
Electron can turn your car into a cloud connected device!

Carloop's PCB connects your car's CAN bus network to the Photon, Electron and Duo. It also provides battery power and a GPS to track location.

## Features

* High-speed CAN transceiver [adapted from the OpenXC project](https://github.com/openxc/reference-vi/blob/gh-pages/electrical/design/can.mkd)
* Get power from the OBD-II port using [a robust circuit adapted from the OpenXC project](https://github.com/openxc/reference-vi/blob/gh-pages/electrical/design/power.mkd)
* GPS connector
* Stacked components for a more compact development kit than a
traditional 90-degrees PCB mount OBD-II connector.
* Powered by the Particle platform!

## Software

The [Carloop Library](https://github.com/carloop/carloop-library) is available on Particle's Web IDE.  You will need to flash a [Particle Photon](https://store.carloop.io/products/particle-photon), [Particle Electron](https://store.carloop.io/products/particle-electron) or [RedBear Duo](https://store.carloop.io/products/redbear-duo) with an example app which can ben found in Carloop Library.
